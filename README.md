# DS 595: Information Retrieval & Social Web
## Car Review Analysis

### Introduction
The internet has put everything to our fingertips, from buying groceries to researching for a new house. Internet has now become a forum where the end user evaluates every product and service based on other like-minded user's experience about it. And the case is no longer like that in older days when consumer itself used and evaluated the product. Customer Reviews is considered unbiased and true quality of the product.
Car purchase has been simpler in earlier days: decide a budget, look among the limited options you have, take a test drive, understand car features and Ta-dah!! You have a new car. But then you start experiencing some issues with your car within a few months. May be the sales person hid some feature problems about the model.
For the same reason, buyer wants to go through customer reviews posted online about the product to make better decisions for his next automobile purchase.
However, the amount of reviews received for each product is huge and is cumbersome for any individual to be able to go through each of them and evaluate the product. Thus it becomes important for both customer and companies to be able to get a quick summary of the user experience so as to make better decisions of going with the product or not.
